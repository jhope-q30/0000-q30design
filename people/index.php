                        <p><strong>I spend a lot of time on client service.</strong> I’m proud that our major clients have been with us for 10 to 20 years. It’s a testament to our view that client relationships can’t be self-serving – we all benefit from relationships that mature with time and value mutual respect. This won't get us hired – our design expertise will – but it helps make sure they keep coming back.</p>

                        <p><strong>My role has evolved greatly</strong> over the years. Today, I’m the account manager, art director and the partner in charge of operations. I really enjoy seeing projects evolve, from the inklings of a strategy all the way to final output.</p>
                        <p><strong>I’m able to interpret “that certain something”</strong> that makes clients unique, so that our designers can build an ownable visual language. I always want clients to know that we have their back and they are getting the best value.</p>
                        <p><strong>Art surprises and delights</strong> in a way that’s also true of great design. Janet Cardiff & George Bures Miller's art installation, The Forty Part Motet, was so powerful and simple. It’s just 40 audio speakers arranged in a circle, each one channeling a different voice in a choir. As the music kept building, I felt a visceral reaction of joy that made my stomach quiver. I watched as other people experienced it and watched the delight on their faces. It was magical.</p>

                        <p><strong>Interactive isn’t a separate discipline.</strong> All our work is rooted in the design process, which to me is about asking the right questions to solve the right problems. Even though I'm heavily involved in all our interactive work, I also participate in other design-related activities in the studio, like brand identity and print work.</p>
                        <p><strong>Everybody wins when clients are an active participant</strong> in the design process. Client opinions, insight, and expertise are critical to the success of any project. I encourage and facilitate open collaboration between q30 and client teams as much as possible.</p>
                        <p><strong>I love running long distances</strong> through Toronto’s riverside and lakefront parks. I particularly like the wilder parts of High Park and the Humber River Valley. Running has the dual effect of clearing my mind and filling it with new thoughts and ideas.</p>

                        <p><strong>To be a good designer you have to be able to cross boundaries</strong>. I work on everything: identity and brand development, print and web collateral, information design, interactive design, illustration, icons.</p>
                        <p><strong>A brand is something that is experienced</strong>. As designers, it’s our job to make this experience tangible, consistent and positive at every touchpoint.</p>
                        <p><strong>I think it’s important to spend some time</strong> living in a place that still runs on low tech – or, better yet, being unplugged for a few days. It makes you aware of how much we depend on technology to keep us connected. It also makes you appreciate and focus on what’s truly important: face time.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p><strong>As a designer, I seek variety in what I do.</strong> Whether it is print, web, mobile or motion design, I give form to ideas people can see and experience.</p>
                        <p><strong>Creativity and understanding your clients</strong> turn feelings of fear from staring at a blank canvas into excitement when you create something beautiful and functional. Reflecting on where you were and how far you have come with a project is one of my favourite parts about designing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sometimes I (intentionally) take the scenic route.</strong> Exploratory walks to nowhere in particular is my favourite way of discovering.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p><strong>As a writer and content strategist</strong>, I’m dedicated to focusing on complexity and community. The job of a writer is to offer avenues for users to explore, connect, and discover. I try to put these perspectives into practice both as a professional and as a community member. My background is in digital marketing and journalism, both as a team leader and as a freelancer.</p>

                        <p><strong>Effective content strategy embraces complexity and serves a role.</strong> Content should fill a need and delivers a cohesive message, where each piece is valuable both independently and as part of a collective.</p>

                        <p><strong>I’m a total dog person.</strong> Please don&#39;t hesitate to show me pictures of your dog.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p><strong>I've been an active part of Toronto's digital community</strong> for over 15 years, working hard to earn the reputation as a dedicated and forthright project manager, influenced by my mentor. Over the years, I’ve grown and changed while watching and experiencing the digital landscape change alongside me.</p>

                        <p><strong>The different layers of challenging work</strong> and diverse opportunities have nurtured my work ethic, impacted my social and environmental views and blessed me with some great and lasting friendships.</p>

                        <p><strong>Years ago, I set out to see as much of Europe</strong> as I could fit into 3 months. I returned 2 years later, having lived in a hut, worked on a potato farm, and toured the coast from the North of France to the Algarve. All of these experiences have influenced me in so many ways. I’ve gained new perspectives, grown my confidence and changed my priorities. I am so appreciative and grateful that I made the decision to stay on.</p>

                        <p><strong>“Organized efficiency” is what I strive for</strong> as Studio Manager. It’s my job to help ensure a place for everything, and everything in its place. The more that’s true, the more everyone here can focus on doing their best work.</p>
                        <p><strong>If there’s a q30 style, it’s clean, clear, and concise.</strong> All the “c” words!</p>
                        <p><strong>Music speaks to me.</strong> I don’t know what it is about the “Nimrod” movement from Elgar’s Enigma Variations, but it moves me deeply each and every time I hear it. It’s an amazing piece of music.</p>
